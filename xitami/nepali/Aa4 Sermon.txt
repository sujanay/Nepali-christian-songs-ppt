aa4 Sermon
utf-8~Aa4

अरुलाई दोस नदिनुहोस ।
नम्रताको स्थानमा उभिनुपर्छ ।
यो मेरो गल्ति हो भन सक्नुपर्छ ?

म बदली हुनुपर्छ ।

अभियान:
१. सम्बन्ध र मित्र
२. बिनयी
३. नम्रता
४. क्षमा र पुनर्जीवित गर्नुपर्छ

भिनाताले परिचय दिदैन

अभियान एकदाम बिनयी हुन्छ ।

येशू अभियान चाहनुहुछ ।

१. तपाईंले कसरि अगुवाई गर्नुहुन्छ?

प्रेम
कृपा
विश्‍वासता

This is a movement of Nepali-speaking emerging leaders who will work for the Kingdom "glocally" (global yet local) for raising and mobilizing cross-cultural, multi-cultural and multi-generational churches.

1. In the light of the sessions and interactions so far, how do you find the vision of HimGlo and how do you think it will impact your life and ministry in your country?

2. How do you see yourself contributing and being a part of this movement?

3. List a few practical steps you would take as a group to see this movement grow.

4. How can you take back this vision to your region and still connect to a larger vision of HimGlo nationally and globally?

5. Now that you have gathered as one larger group (national), please try to break into functional regions for the better implementation of the vision, according to geographical and the density of the leaders represented in this HimGlo.

6. From the whole group, how best do you see yourselves being divided into regions, keeping in mind that local leadership initiative is vital to form the regions?

Good Night!
