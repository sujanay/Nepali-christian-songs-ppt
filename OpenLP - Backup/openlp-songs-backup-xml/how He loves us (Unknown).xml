    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>And He is jealous for me.<br/>Love's like a hurricane. I  am a tree,<br/>Bending beneath the weight of <br/>His wind and mercy.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>When all of a sudden,<br/>I am unaware of these afflictions eclipsed by glory.<br/>And I realize just how beautiful You are,<br/>And how great Your affections are for me.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>And, oh,  how He loves us, oh.<br/>Oh, how He loves us.<br/>How He loves us, oh.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>And we are His portion and He is our prize,<br/>Drawn to redemption by the grace in His eyes.<br/>If His grace is an ocean, we're all sinking.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>And Heaven meets earth like an unforeseen kiss.<br/>And my heart turns violently inside of my chest.<br/>I don't have time to maintain these regrets,<br/>When I think about the way...</lines>
